<h2> Create a HTML file</h2>
<p> Let;s create an html file in your computer and open on a browser</p>
<p> Go to the location where you want to store your file and create a file with the name <code>index.html</code>. Open the file on the browser as well in a code editor of your choice and keep both open on the screen so you can see changes as you are going.</p>

<h2>HTML Tags</h2>
<p> HTML is based in tags, tags are special text to distinguish parts of your webpage, this tags tell the browser to display whatever is inside the tag in a specific way</p>
<p> The first tag the you need is the <code>< !DOCTYPE html ></code>, to tell the browser that this is an html file.</p>
<p> After it, you have the main html tag <code>< html ></code> this insure that all the content inside it will inherit some necessary characteristics of HTML.<p>
<p> Your content usually will be divided into 2 sections, the head and the body, the head tag conatins info about the website and where you load CSS and javascript files. The body tag is the main content on the webpage.</p>
  <h3> Head Tags </h3>
<p> Now let's go on some basics tags that are commumly used in the head</p>
<p> The first tag that you should have in your head is <code> < meta charset="utf-8" ></code>, this is a type of unicode, it's used virtually in all websites, we need incoding because we need to translate the letters, numbers and symbols into bytes.</p>
<p> The next meta tag that should be in all websites is <code>< meta name+"viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" ></code>, this will make sure that your website will display properly in all kind of devices, pc's, phones, tablets, etc... The content in this tag is saying that it should make the width of the website the smae width as the whatever devicethat is using it. Then the initial scale sets the zoom of the website</p>
  <p> Another very important tag is the <code>< title ></code>, this tag set's the title of the webpage, if a website have different pages, each page can have his own title.</p>
  <h3> Body Tags</h3>
  <p> Now let's go for tags in the body</p>
  <p> Most of the body tags are based of things you can do in word documents, create head lines, bold text, make lists and even tables. Lets go to some basics tags, some of them aren't used anymore because CSS to achieve the same style, but i think it's still helpfull to at least know what these tags are</p>
  <p> First we have the <code>H</code> tag that range from <code> h1 to h6</code>, this is the header tag, the <code>h1</code> is the highest in priority and it's generally used for the title of the page.</p>
  <p> The next tag is the <code>p</code> tag, it's stands for paragraph, it's used to seperate your content into blocks. Like this guide</p>
  <p> If you want to create a break of line with out the space in between that the tag <code>p</code> gives you can you use the break tag <code>br</code>
<p> If you want to explore more and more tags, you can come <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target"_blank">here</a>
  <p> Wait a minute, and how do we link stuff?</p>
  <p> Thats the <code>a</code> tag and in addition to the tag, we need to had an atribute, the main atribute we need to had to an a tag it's the <code>href</code>, it stands for hypertext reference, and inside the atribute you have to put the URL the pages you want to link to, ex: <code>< a href="https://github.com/benmaia" target"_blank">my github< /a ></code>
